- check and if needed correct pos values of the dict entries by means of the current version of the smn-FST

- using the smn-FST, too, I have to generate the word forms as requested by Hannu Kangasniemi for a “printed” version (HTML/PDF/etc.)
 - for N: Gen+Sg form
 - for A: Attr form
 - for V: Sg1 form and for a specific group the Sg3 form
